          From W.O. Bentley, who founded Bentley Motors in 1919, to the current
          team of over 4,000 dedicated employees, the company’s extraordinary
          cars have always been designed and built by exceptional people using
          only the finest of materials. They have always been driven by
          exceptional people, too. From the passionate Bentley Boys and Girls
          who raced the cars in the 1920s, encouraging W.O. Bentley to achieve
          ever greater feats of engineering, to the visionary Bentley owners of
          today, Bentley drivers help to shape the world around them.
          <br /><br />
          In 2020 Bentley Motors launched the ‘Beyond100’ manifesto, which
          outlines our intention to become the most sustainable luxury
          automotive brand in the world. As a brand we are constantly looking
          forwards, using the links below you will find our technological
          innovations and future vision for Bentley.
